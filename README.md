## Scheme (structure) of the documents in the database

<font color="red">Need to update this</font>
The data is stored in a document (NoSQL) database hosted by Google Firebase. The documents are organized to achieve the functionalities described in the project description.

## Badges
<font color="red">Check what is this and if a must</font>
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals

<font color="red">Nice to have some images</font>
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
